This is a collection of my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge written in [Go](https://go.dev/)


## Running
``` shell
go run main.go -day <day> -part <part>
```
### Example
This will run both solutions for day 1
``` shell

```
Will output:
```
Running Day 1 Part 1
------------
Part 1: 54940

Running Day 1 Part 2
